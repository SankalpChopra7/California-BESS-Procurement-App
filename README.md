California BESS Procurement + Weather Software 

Provided a scraped excel database that comprises of 5 different sheets. The first sheet defines California County Data - California County, Service Types, Company Name, link to their Google Contact information, and location on google maps. The second is for Arizona County data and starts by defining Arizona counties, Service type, company name, notes on the company, placeholder company website, and location on google maps. The third sheet is the same for Texas. In the fourth sheet, I have defined the top suppliers of BESS equipment in each of the three states with a little summary about their key presence. This is for different BESS equipment materials. In the fifth sheet, I have listed all the current BESS projects currently being executed and their location and capacity. 

I want to use openstreetmaps api, cesiumJS, free weather api to chart out each of these companies on a 2d and 3d map. The goal is for this to help with local procurement for new BESS (battery energy storage system) by showing local suppliers for materials. How do you intend to implement this
